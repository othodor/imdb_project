But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.","Kate Atkinson,Katrina Milosevic,Robbie Magasiva,Jacqueline Brennan,Celia Ireland,Pamela Rabe,Kate Jenkinson,Lauri McLennan,Lucia Brancatisano,Bernard Curry,Nicole da Silva,Shareena Clanton,Eloise Wright,Danielle Cormack,Tammy Macintosh,Rarriwuy Hick,Katherine Grinlaw,Susie Porter",English,Australia

Omer gets eventually declared dead in prison, but the death is a cover up for the revenge to come.

But first, he has to kill the constant, incorrigible, and endless love he still carries for the girl of his dreams, Eysan. One by one, the pieces fall in place in a very thrilling story. Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal.

Shorten that to every second, and you've got Coupling. It's more than just a one night stand! When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's ""porn buddy"" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. With a new guy on the scene, a baby on the way, commitment in the air, and love on the horizon, the dynamics of the six friends are definitely changing. At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little ""un-edited"" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards. Can fallen playboy Patrick ever find his way back from the enchanted glade of his one true love and get a decent night's sleep?","Jack Davenport,Gina Bellman,Sarah Alexander,Kate Isitt,Ben Miles,Richard Coyle,Richard Mylan,Lou Gish,Olivia Caffrey,Mariella Frostrup,Lloyd Owen,Elizabeth Marmur,Emilia Fox,Adam Astill,Michael Price,Amanda Abbington,Anat Dychtwald,Raji James",English,United Kingdom

Now Commander Adama of the Battlestar Galatica and President Laura Roslin lead a ragtag fleet of refugees in a supposed search for the fabled lost thirteenth colony, Earth. However, the dangers they face are many, which compound an already difficult situation. In addition to the Cylons hunting and attacking the fleet in space and their infiltrator units carrying out sabotage--even as their former unwitting pawn, Gaius Baltar, helps in the hunt for them while hiding both his own guilt and the strange presence that haunts his every thought--the fleet also faces internal political conflict in which the rabble-rousing figure Tom Zarek is merely the loudest dissenting voice, not to mention recurring shortages of food, water, and even oxygen. In the midst of these trials, however, clues begin to appear to suggest that Adama's bluff about finding Earth might hold more truth than anyone could have guessed.","Edward James Olmos,Mary McDonnell,Jamie Bamber,James Callis,Tricia Helfer,Grace Park,Katee Sackhoff,Michael Hogan,Aaron Douglas,Tahmoh Penikett,Alessandro Juliani,Kandyse McClure,Bodie Olmos,Donnelly Rhodes,Michael Trucco,Nicki Clyne,Leah Cairns,Rekha Sharma",English,"United States,Canada"
